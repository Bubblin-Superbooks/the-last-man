<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If I lift up my eyes and see the desart earth, and feel that those dear eyes have spent their mortal lustre, and that those beauteous lips are silent, their "crimson leaves" faded, for ever I am mute!</p><p>But you live, my Idris, even now you move before me! There was a glade, O reader! a grassy opening in the wood; the retiring trees left its velvet expanse as a temple for love; the silver Thames bounded it on one side, and a willow bending down dipt in the water its Naiad hair, dishevelled by the wind's viewless hand. The oaks around were the home of a tribe of nightingales--there am I now; Idris, in youth's dear prime, is by my side --remember, I am just twenty-two, and seventeen summers have scarcely passed over the beloved of my heart.</p></div> </div>
