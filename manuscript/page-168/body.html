Day, hateful to me, dawned; I retreated to my lodgings--I threw myself on a couch--I slept--was it sleep?--for thought was still alive--love and despair struggled still, and I writhed with unendurable pain.</p><p>I awoke half stupefied; I felt a heavy oppression on me, but knew not wherefore; I entered, as it were, the council-chamber of my brain, and questioned the various ministers of thought therein assembled; too soon I remembered all; too soon my limbs quivered beneath the tormenting power; soon, too soon, I knew myself a slave!</p></div> </div>
