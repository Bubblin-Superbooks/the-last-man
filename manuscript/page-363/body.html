<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The silly moon and inconstant planets vary nightly their erratic dance; the sun itself, sovereign of the sky, ever and anon deserts his throne, and leaves his dominion to night and winter. Nature grows old, and shakes in her decaying limbs,--creation has become bankrupt! What wonder then, that eclipse and death have led to destruction the light of thy life, O Perdita!"</p></div> </div>
