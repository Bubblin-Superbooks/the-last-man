<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,</p><p>even now I had accompanied them to their new and incommunicable abode.</p><p>Never shall I see them more. I am bereft of their dear converse--bereft of sight of them. I am a tree rent by lightning; never will the bark close over the bared fibres--never will their quivering life, torn by the winds, receive the opiate of a moment's balm. I am alone in the world-- but that expression as yet was less pregnant with misery, than that Adrian and Clara are dead.</p><p>The tide of thought and feeling rolls on for ever the same, though the banks and shapes around, which govern its course, and the reflection in the wave, vary. Thus the sentiment of immediate loss in some sort decayed, while that of utter, irremediable loneliness grew on me with time.</p></div> </div>
