<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> the snow-clad fields seen through the silvered trunks of the beeches,--the brook, in days of happiness alive with sparkling waters, now choked by ice--the leafless trees fantastically dressed in hoar frost--the shapes of summer leaves imaged by winter's frozen hand on the hard ground--the dusky sky, drear cold, and unbroken silence--while close in my bosom, my feathered nursling lay warm, and safe, speaking its content with a light chirp-- painful reflections thronged, stirring my brain with wild commotion--cold and death-like as the snowy fields was all earth--misery-stricken the life-tide of the inhabitants--why should I oppose the cataract of destruction that swept us away?--why string my nerves and renew my wearied efforts--ah, why? But that my firm courage and cheerful exertions might shelter the dear mate, whom I chose in the spring of my life;</p></div> </div>
