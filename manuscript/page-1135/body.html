Her barbarous tyranny came to its close here in the rocky vale of Chamounix.</p><p>Still recurring scenes of misery and pain, the fruits of this distemper, made no more a part of our lives--the word plague no longer rung in our ears--the aspect of plague incarnate in the human countenance no longer appeared before our eyes. From this moment I saw plague no more. She abdicated her throne, and despoiled herself of her imperial sceptre among the ice rocks that surrounded us. She left solitude and silence co-heirs of her kingdom.</p></div> </div>
