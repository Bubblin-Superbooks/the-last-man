The fellow soon discovered that his rival was preferred to him; and this changed what was at first a chance admiration into a passion, whose main springs were envy, and a base desire to deprive his competitor of the advantage he enjoyed over himself.</p><p>Poor Lucy's sad story was but a common one.

In the meantime disastrous poverty came on Lucy.</p></div> </div>
