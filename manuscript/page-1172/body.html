<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When winds that move not its calm surface, sweep The azure sea, I love the land no more; The smiles of the serene and tranquil deep Tempt my unquiet mind--</p><p>Thus said Adrian, quoting a translation of Moschus's poem, as in the clear morning light, we rowed over the Laguna, past Lido, into the open sea--I would have added in continuation,</p><p>But when the roar Of ocean's gray abyss resounds, and foam Gathers upon the sea, and vast waves burst--</p><p>But my friends declared that such verses were evil augury; so in cheerful mood we left the shallow waters, and, when out at sea, unfurled our sails to catch the favourable breeze. The laughing morning air filled them, while sun-light bathed earth, sky and ocean--the placid waves divided to receive our keel, and playfully kissed the dark sides of our little skiff, murmuring a welcome;</p></div> </div>
