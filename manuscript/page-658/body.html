He appeared given up to contemplation, averse to excitement, a lowly student, a man of visions-- but afford him worthy theme, and--</p><p>Like to the lark at break of day arising, From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate.[1]</p><p>so did he spring up from listlessness and unproductive thought, to the highest pitch of virtuous action.</p><p>With him went enthusiasm, the high-wrought resolve, the eye that without blenching could look at death. With us remained sorrow, anxiety, and unendurable expectation of evil. The man, says Lord Bacon, who hath wife and children, has given hostages to fortune. Vain was all philosophical reasoning--vain all fortitude--vain, vain, a reliance on probable good. I might heap high the scale with logic, courage, and resignation--but let one fear for Idris and our children enter the opposite one, and, over-weighed, it kicked the beam.</p></div> </div>
