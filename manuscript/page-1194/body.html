<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What a pitiable, forlorn, disconsolate being I was! My very aspect and garb told the tale of my despair. My hair was matted and wild--my limbs soiled with salt ooze; while at sea, I had thrown off those of my garments that encumbered me, and the rain drenched the thin summer-clothing I had retained--my feet were bare, and the stunted reeds and broken shells made them bleed--the while, I hurried to and fro, now looking earnestly on some distant rock which, islanded in the sands, bore for a moment a deceptive appearance--now with flashing eyes reproaching the murderous ocean for its unutterable cruelty.</p><p>For a moment I compared myself to that monarch of the waste--Robinson Crusoe. We had been both thrown companionless--he on the shore of a desolate island: I on that of a desolate world. I was rich in the so called goods of life.</p></div> </div>
