She felt as if during her past calm she had dreamed, but was now awake; she was</p><p>As one In some lone watch-tower on the deep, awakened From soothing visions of the home he loves, Trembling to hear the wrathful billows roar;[6]</p><p>as one who has been cradled by a storm, and awakes to find the vessel sinking. Before, she had been visited by pangs of fear--now, she never enjoyed an interval of hope. No smile of the heart ever irradiated her fair countenance; sometimes she forced one, and then gushing tears would flow, and the sea of grief close above these wrecks of past happiness. Still while I was near her, she could not be in utter despair-- she fully confided herself to me--she did not seem to fear my death, or revert to its possibility;</p></div> </div>
