There was a winning softness in his voice, that went to the heart of the little girl; she looked at him, then snatching her hand from me, threw herself into his arms, clinging round his neck, ejaculating--"Save me! save me!" while her unnatural sullenness dissolved in tears.</p><p>"I will save you," he replied, "of what are you afraid? you need not fear my friend, he will do you no harm. Are you alone?"</p><p>"No, Lion is with me."</p><p>"And your father and mother?--"</p><p>"I never had any; I am a charity girl. Every body is gone, gone for a great, great many days; but if they come back and find me out, they will beat me so!"</p></div> </div>
