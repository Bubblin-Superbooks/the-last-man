<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But it will please me to see you each day! to listen to the public voice praising you; to keep up your paternal love for our girl; to hear your voice; to know that I am near you, though you are no longer mine.</p><p>"If you wish to break the chains that bind us, say the word, and it shall be done--I will take all the blame on myself, of harshness or unkindness, in the world's eye.</p><p>"Yet, as I have said, I should be best pleased, at least for the present, to live under the same roof with you. When the fever of my young life is spent; when placid age shall tame the vulture that devours me, friendship may come, love and hope being dead. May this be true? Can my soul, inextricably linked to this perishable frame, become lethargic and cold, even as this sensitive mechanism shall lose its youthful elasticity?</p></div> </div>
