<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I was long wrapt by such ideas; but the soul wearies of a pauseless flight; and, stooping from its wheeling circuits round and round this spot, suddenly it fell ten thousand fathom deep, into the abyss of the present-- into self-knowledge--into tenfold sadness. I roused myself--I cast off my waking dreams; and I, who just now could almost hear the shouts of the Roman throng, and was hustled by countless multitudes, now beheld the desart ruins of Rome sleeping under its own blue sky; the shadows lay tranquilly on the ground; sheep were grazing untended on the Palatine, and a buffalo stalked down the Sacred Way that led to the Capitol. I was alone in the Forum; alone in Rome; alone in the world. Would not one living man --one companion in my weary solitude, be worth all the glory and remembered power of this time-honoured city? Double sorrow--sadness, bred in Cimmerian caves, robed my soul in a mourning garb.</p></div> </div>
