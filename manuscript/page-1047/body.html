<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Come, and fear not; long before day we shall be at Versailles; close the door on this abode of crime --come, sweet Juliet, from hypocrisy and guilt to the society of the affectionate and good."</p><p>I spoke hurriedly, but with fervour: and while with gentle violence I drew her from the portal, some thought, some recollection of past scenes of youth and happiness, made her listen and yield to me; suddenly she broke away with a piercing shriek:--"My child, my child! he has my child; my darling girl is my hostage."</p><p>She darted from me into the passage; the gate closed between us--she was left in the fangs of this man of crime, a prisoner, still to inhale the pestilential atmosphere which adhered to his demoniac nature; the unimpeded breeze played on my cheek, the moon shone graciously upon me, my path was free. Glad to have escaped, yet melancholy in my very joy, I retrod my steps to Versailles.</p></div> </div>
