<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had been a fool to remain in Rome all this time: Rome noted for Malaria, the famous caterer for death. But it was still possible, that, could I visit the whole extent of earth, I should find in some part of the wide extent a survivor. Methought the sea-side was the most probable retreat to be chosen by such a one. If left alone in an inland district, still they could not continue in the spot where their last hopes had been extinguished; they would journey on, like me, in search of a partner for their solitude, till the watery barrier stopped their further progress.</p><p>To that water--cause of my woes, perhaps now to be their cure, I would betake myself. Farewell, Italy!--farewell, thou ornament of the world, matchless Rome, the retreat of the solitary one during long months!</p></div> </div>
