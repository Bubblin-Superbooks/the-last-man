You may believe that I did not enter on my present line of conduct without reluctance and pain. I knew that it was possible that your suspicions might be excited; but I trusted that my simple word would cause them to disappear. I built my hope on your confidence. Do you think that I will be questioned, and my replies disdainfully set aside? Do you think that I will be suspected, perhaps watched, cross-questioned, and disbelieved? I am not yet fallen so low; my honour is not yet so tarnished. You have loved me; I adored you. But all human sentiments come to an end. Let our affection expire--but let it not be exchanged for distrust and recrimination. Heretofore we have been friends--lovers--let us not become enemies, mutual spies. I cannot live the object of suspicion--you cannot believe me--let us part!"</p></div> </div>
