I was indignant that he should sit at the same table with the companions of Raymond--men of abandoned characters, or rather without any, the refuse of high-bred luxury, the disgrace of their country. "Let me entreat Adrian," I cried, "not to comply: rather join with me in endeavouring to withdraw Lord Raymond from this scene, and restore him to other society."</p><p>"My good fellow," said Raymond, "this is neither the time nor place for the delivery of a moral lecture: take my word for it that my amusements and society are not so bad as you imagine. We are neither hypocrites or fools --for the rest, 'Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?'"</p></div> </div>
