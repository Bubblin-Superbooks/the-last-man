<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Many living deaths have I borne for thee, O Raymond, and now I expire, thy victim!--By my death I purchase thee-- lo! the instruments of war, fire, the plague are my servitors. I dared, I conquered them all, till now! I have sold myself to death, with the sole condition that thou shouldst follow me--Fire, and war, and plague, unite for thy destruction--O my Raymond, there is no safety for thee!"</p><p>With an heavy heart I listened to the changes of her delirium; I made her a bed of cloaks; her violence decreased and a clammy dew stood on her brow as the paleness of death succeeded to the crimson of fever, I placed her on the cloaks. She continued to rave of her speedy meeting with her beloved in the grave, of his death nigh at hand; sometimes she solemnly declared that he was summoned; sometimes she bewailed his hard destiny.</p></div> </div>
