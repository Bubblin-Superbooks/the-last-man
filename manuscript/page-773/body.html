For a long time I dared not hope; but when his unobstructed breathing and the moisture that suffused his forehead, were tokens no longer to be mistaken of the departure of mortal malady, I ventured to whisper the news of the change to Idris, and at length succeeded in persuading her that I spoke truth.</p><p>But neither this assurance, nor the speedy convalescence of our child could restore her, even to the portion of peace she before enjoyed.</p></div> </div>
