It became necessary, that I should look my disaster in the face-- not playing the school-boy's part of obedience without submission; enduring life, and yet rebelling against the laws by which I lived.</p><p>Yet how could I resign myself?

Why did I continue to live-- why not throw off the weary weight of time, and with my own hand, let out the fluttering prisoner from my agonized breast?--It was not cowardice that withheld me; for the true fortitude was to endure; and death had a soothing sound accompanying it, that would easily entice me to enter its demesne. But this I would not do.</p></div> </div>
