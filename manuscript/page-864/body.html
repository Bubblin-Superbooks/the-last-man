<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In vagabond pursuit of dreadful safety.</p><p>Yet let us go! England is in her shroud,--we may not enchain ourselves to a corpse. Let us go--the world is our country now, and we will choose for our residence its most fertile spot. Shall we, in these desart halls, under this wintry sky, sit with closed eyes and folded hands, expecting death? Let us rather go out to meet it gallantly: or perhaps--for all this pendulous orb, this fair gem in the sky's diadem, is not surely plague-striken--perhaps, in some secluded nook, amidst eternal spring, and waving trees, and purling streams, we may find Life. The world is vast, and England, though her many fields and wide spread woods seem interminable, is but a small part of her.</p></div> </div>
