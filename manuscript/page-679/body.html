<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"That country and my beloved sister are all I have. I will protect the first--the latter I commit to your charge. If I survive, and she be lost, I were far better dead. Preserve her--for her own sake I know that you will--if you require any other spur, think that, in preserving her, you preserve me. Her faultless nature, one sum of perfections, is wrapt up in her affections--if they were hurt, she would droop like an unwatered floweret, and the slightest injury they receive is a nipping frost to her. Already she fears for us. She fears for the children she adores, and for you, the father of these, her lover, husband, protector; and you must be near her to support and encourage her. Return to Windsor then, my brother; for such you are by every tie--fill the double place my absence imposes on you, and let me, in all my sufferings here, turn my eyes towards that dear seclusion, and say--There is peace."</p></div> </div>
