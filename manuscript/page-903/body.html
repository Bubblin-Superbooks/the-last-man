<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Let us not, through security in hereafter, neglect the present. This present moment, short as it is, is a part of eternity, and the dearest part, since it is our own unalienably. Thou, the hope of my futurity, art my present joy.

My eyes were bloodshot, starting from my head; every artery beat, methought, audibly, every muscle throbbed, each single nerve felt.

I cannot live long--but, again and again, I say, this moment is ours!"</p></div> </div>
