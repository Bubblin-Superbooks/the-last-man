<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I AWOKE in the morning, just as the higher windows of the lofty houses received the first beams of the rising sun. The birds were chirping, perched on the windows sills and deserted thresholds of the doors. I awoke, and my first thought was, Adrian and Clara are dead. I no longer shall be hailed by their good-morrow--or pass the long day in their society. I shall never see them more. The ocean has robbed me of them--stolen their hearts of love from their breasts, and given over to corruption what was dearer to me than light, or life, or hope.</p><p>I was an untaught shepherd-boy, when Adrian deigned to confer on me his friendship. The best years of my life had been passed with him. All I had possessed of this world's goods, of happiness, knowledge, or virtue--I owed to him.</p></div> </div>
