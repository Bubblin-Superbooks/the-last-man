<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nature was the same, as when she was the kind mother of the human race; now, childless and forlorn, her fertility was a mockery; her loveliness a mask for deformity. Why should the breeze gently stir the trees, man felt not its refreshment? Why did dark night adorn herself with stars--man saw them not? Why are there fruits, or flowers, or streams, man is not here to enjoy them?</p><p>Idris stood beside me, her dear hand locked in mine. Her face was radiant with a smile.--"The sun is alone," she said, "but we are not. A strange star, my Lionel, ruled our birth; sadly and with dismay we may look upon the annihilation of man; but we remain for each other. Did I ever in the wide world seek other than thee? And since in the wide world thou remainest, why should I complain? Thou and nature are still true to me.</p></div> </div>
