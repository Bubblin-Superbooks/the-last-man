<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I came to an open space--a mountain of ruin in the midst, announced that some large mosque had occupied the space--and here, scattered about, I saw various articles of luxury and wealth, singed, destroyed--but shewing what they had been in their ruin--jewels, strings of pearls, embroidered robes, rich furs, glittering tapestries, and oriental ornaments, seemed to have been collected here in a pile destined for destruction; but the rain had stopped the havoc midway.</p><p>Hours passed, while in this scene of ruin I sought for Raymond. Insurmountable heaps sometimes opposed themselves; the still burning fires scorched me. The sun set; the atmosphere grew dim--and the evening star no longer shone companionless. The glare of flames attested the progress of destruction, while, during mingled light and obscurity, the piles around me took gigantic proportions and weird shapes.</p></div> </div>
