She seemed to consider that through me she had lost Raymond; I was the evil influence of her life; I was even accused of encreasing and confirming the mad and base apostacy of Adrian from all views of advancement and grandeur; and now this miserable mountaineer was to steal her daughter.

As it was, the sweet girl's generous nature was roused to defend, and ally herself with, my despised cause.</p></div> </div>
