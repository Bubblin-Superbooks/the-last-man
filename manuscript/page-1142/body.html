<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>--Forests, ancient as the hills,</p><p>And folding sunny spots of greenery, where the chamois grazed, and the timid squirrel laid up its hoard--descanting on the charms of nature, drinking in the while her unalienable beauties--we were, in an empty world, happy.</p><p>Yet, O days of joy--days, when eye spoke to eye, and voices, sweeter than the music of the swinging branches of the pines, or rivulet's gentle murmur, answered mine--yet, O days replete with beatitude, days of loved society--days unutterably dear to me forlorn--pass, O pass before me, making me in your memory forget what I am. Behold, how my streaming eyes blot this senseless paper--behold, how my features are convulsed by agonizing throes, at your mere recollection, now that, alone, my tears flow, my lips quiver, my cries fill the air, unseen, unmarked, unheard! Yet, O yet, days of delight! let me dwell on your long-drawn hours!</p></div> </div>
