<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As an unsheltered northern shore Is shaken by the wintry wave-- And frequent storms for evermore, (While from the west the loud winds rave, Or from the east, or mountains hoar) The struck and tott'ring sand-bank lave.[1]</p><p>It required more than human energy to bear up against the menaces of destruction that every where surrounded us.</p><p>After the lapse of three days, the gale died away, the sea-gull sailed upon the calm bosom of the windless atmosphere, and the last yellow leaf on the topmost branch of the oak hung without motion. The sea no longer broke with fury; but a swell setting in steadily for shore, with long sweep and sullen burst replaced the roar of the breakers. Yet we derived hope from the change, and we did not doubt that after the interval of a few days the sea would resume its tranquillity. The sunset of the fourth day favoured this idea; it was clear and golden.</p></div> </div>
