<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A year has passed since I have been thus occupied. The seasons have made their wonted round, and decked this eternal city in a changeful robe of surpassing beauty. A year has passed; and I no longer guess at my state or my prospects--loneliness is my familiar, sorrow my inseparable companion. I have endeavoured to brave the storm--I have endeavoured to school myself to fortitude--I have sought to imbue myself with the lessons of wisdom. It will not do. My hair has become nearly grey--my voice, unused now to utter sound, comes strangely on my ears. My person, with its human powers and features, seem to me a monstrous excrescence of nature. How express in human language a woe human being until this hour never knew! How give intelligible expression to a pang none but I could ever understand!-- No one has entered Rome. None will ever come.</p></div> </div>
