<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Idris is a gentle, pretty, sweet little girl; it is impossible not to have an affection for her, and I have a very sincere one; only do not speak of love --love, the tyrant and the tyrant-queller; love, until now my conqueror, now my slave; the hungry fire, the untameable beast, the fanged snake--no--no--I will have nothing to do with that love. Tell me, Lionel, do you consent that I should marry this young lady?"</p><p>He bent his keen eyes upon me, and my uncontrollable heart swelled in my bosom. I replied in a calm voice--but how far from calm was the thought imaged by my still words--"Never! I can never consent that Lady Idris should be united to one who does not love her."</p></div> </div>
