If we survive this coming summer, I will not spend the ensuing winter in England; neither I nor any of us."</p><p>I spoke without much heed, and the very conclusion of what I said brought with it other thoughts. Should we, any of us, survive the coming summer? I saw the brow of Idris clouded; I again felt, that we were enchained to the car of fate, over whose coursers we had no control. We could no longer say, This we will do, and this we will leave undone.</p></div> </div>
