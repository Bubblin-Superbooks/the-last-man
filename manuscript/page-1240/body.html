<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As if in the same soil you plant nightshade and a myrtle tree, they will each appropriate the mould, moisture, and air administered, for the fostering their several properties--so did my grief find sustenance, and power of existence, and growth, in what else had been divine manna, to feed radiant meditation. Ah! while I streak this paper with the tale of what my so named occupations were--while I shape the skeleton of my days--my hand trembles--my heart pants, and my brain refuses to lend expression, or phrase, or idea, by which to image forth the veil of unutterable woe that clothed these bare realities. O, worn and beating heart, may I dissect thy fibres, and tell how in each unmitigable misery, sadness dire, repinings, and despair, existed? May I record my many ravings--the wild curses I hurled at torturing nature--and how I have passed days shut out from light and food--from all except the burning hell alive in my own bosom?</p></div> </div>
