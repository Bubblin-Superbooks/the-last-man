She had lived for some years in an alms-house, and on fine Sundays her threshold was constantly beset by a crowd, seeking her advice and listening to her admonitions. She had been a soldier's wife, and had seen the world; infirmity, induced by fevers caught in unwholesome quarters, had come on her before its time, and she seldom moved from her little cot. The plague entered the village; and, while fright and grief deprived the inhabitants of the little wisdom they possessed, old Martha stepped forward and said-- "Before now I have been in a town where there was the plague."--"And you escaped?"--"No, but I recovered."--After this Martha was seated more firmly than ever on the regal seat, elevated by reverence and love.</p></div> </div>
