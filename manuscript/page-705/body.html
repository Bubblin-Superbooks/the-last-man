<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The solitude became intolerable--I placed my hand on the beating heart of Idris, I bent my head to catch the sound of her breath, to assure myself that she still existed--for a moment I doubted whether I should not awake her; so effeminate an horror ran through my frame.--Great God! would it one day be thus? One day all extinct, save myself, should I walk the earth alone? Were these warning voices, whose inarticulate and oracular sense forced belief upon me?</p><p>Yet I would not call them Voices of warning, that announce to us Only the inevitable. As the sun, Ere it is risen, sometimes paints its image In the atmosphere--so often do the spirits Of great events stride on before the events, And in to-day already walks to-morrow.[2]</p></div> </div>
