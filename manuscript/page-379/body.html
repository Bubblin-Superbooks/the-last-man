<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'The bloom has vanished from my life'--there is no morning to this all investing night; no rising to the set-sun of love. In those days the rest of the world was nothing to me: all other men--I never considered nor felt what they were; nor did I look on you as one of them. Separated from them; exalted in my heart; sole possessor of my affections; single object of my hopes, the best half of myself.</p><p>"Ah, Raymond, were we not happy? Did the sun shine on any, who could enjoy its light with purer and more intense bliss? It was not--it is not a common infidelity at which I repine. It is the disunion of an whole which may not have parts; it is the carelessness with which you have shaken off the mantle of election with which to me you were invested, and have become one among the many. Dream not to alter this.</p></div> </div>
