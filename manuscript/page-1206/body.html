<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Three days I wandered through Ravenna--now thinking only of the beloved beings who slept in the oozy caves of ocean--now looking forward on the dread blank before me; shuddering to make an onward step--writhing at each change that marked the progress of the hours.</p><p>For three days I wandered to and fro in this melancholy town. I passed whole hours in going from house to house, listening whether I could detect some lurking sign of human existence. Sometimes I rang at a bell; it tinkled through the vaulted rooms, and silence succeeded to the sound. I called myself hopeless, yet still I hoped; and still disappointment ushered in the hours, intruding the cold, sharp steel which first pierced me, into the aching festering wound. I fed like a wild beast, which seizes its food only when stung by intolerable hunger. I did not change my garb, or seek the shelter of a roof, during all those days.</p></div> </div>
