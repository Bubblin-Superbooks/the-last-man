<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It cannot be that I shall never behold a fellow being more!--never! --never!--not in the course of years!--Shall I wake, and speak to none, pass the interminable hours, my soul, islanded in the world, a solitary point, surrounded by vacuum?

Away! let me fly from the ocean-grave, let me depart from this barren nook, paled in, as it is, from access by its own desolateness; let me tread once again the paved towns; step over the threshold of man's dwellings, and most certainly I shall find this thought a horrible vision--a maddening, but evanescent dream.</p><p>I entered Ravenna, (the town nearest to the spot whereon I had been cast), before the second sun had set on the empty world; I saw many living creatures;</p></div> </div>
