<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>No, no, I will not live among the wild scenes of nature, the enemy of all that lives. I will seek the towns--Rome, the capital of the world, the crown of man's achievements. Among its storied streets, hallowed ruins, and stupendous remains of human exertion, I shall not, as here, find every thing forgetful of man; trampling on his memory, defacing his works, proclaiming from hill to hill, and vale to vale,--by the torrents freed from the boundaries which he imposed--by the vegetation liberated from the laws which he enforced--by his habitation abandoned to mildew and weeds, that his power is lost, his race annihilated for ever.</p><p>I hailed the Tiber, for that was as it were an unalienable possession of humanity. I hailed the wild Campagna, for every rood had been trod by man;</p></div> </div>
