Peril will now be mine; and I hail her as a friend--death will perpetually cross my path, and I will meet him as a benefactor; hardship, inclement weather, and dangerous tempests will be my sworn mates.

I would with a few books, provisions, and my dog, embark in one of these and float down the current of the stream into the sea;</p></div> </div>
