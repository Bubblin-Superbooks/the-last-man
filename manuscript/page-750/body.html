<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All my pretty ones? Did you say all?--O hell kite! All? What! all my pretty chickens, and their dam, At one fell swoop!</p><p>A pang of tameless grief wrenched every heart, a burst of despair was echoed from every lip.--I had entered into the universal feeling--I had been absorbed by the terrors of Rosse--I re-echoed the cry of Macduff, and then rushed out as from an hell of torture, to find calm in the free air and silent street.</p><p>Free the air was not, or the street silent. Oh, how I longed then for the dear soothings of maternal Nature, as my wounded heart was still further stung by the roar of heartless merriment from the public-house, by the sight of the drunkard reeling home, having lost the memory of what he would find there in oblivious debauch, and by the more appalling salutations of those melancholy beings to whom the name of home was a mockery.</p></div> </div>
