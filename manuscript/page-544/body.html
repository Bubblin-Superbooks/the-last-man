<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Do you remember in her infancy, with what transport you beheld Clara, recognizing in her the united being of yourself and Raymond; joying to view in this living temple a manifestation of your eternal loves. Even such is she still. You say that you have lost Raymond. O, no!--yet he lives with you and in you there. From him she sprung, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone--and not, as heretofore, are you content to trace in her downy cheek and delicate limbs, an affinity to Raymond, but in her enthusiastic affections, in the sweet qualities of her mind, you may still find him living, the good, the great, the beloved. Be it your care to foster this similarity--be it your care to render her worthy of him, so that, when she glory in her origin, she take not shame for what she is."</p></div> </div>
