Since that age, it is true, I had lived luxuriously, or at least surrounded by all the conveniences civilization afforded. But before that time, I had been "as uncouth a savage, as the wolf-bred founder of old Rome"--and now, in Rome itself, robber and shepherd propensities, similar to those of its founder, were of advantage to its sole inhabitant. I spent the morning riding and shooting in the Campagna--I passed long hours in the various galleries--I gazed at each statue, and lost myself in a reverie before many a fair Madonna or beauteous nymph.</p></div> </div>
